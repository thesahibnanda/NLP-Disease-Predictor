# NLP Disease Predictor

This is a machine learning-based tool that predicts diseases based on the symptoms provided as input. It uses Natural Language Processing techniques to preprocess the input and generate numerical representations of the symptoms using the BERT model. It then uses a Random Forest classifier to predict the disease.
